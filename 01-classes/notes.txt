The 'class' is the starting point for object oriented programming.

Let's consider we are building a Task app to keep track of tasks.
What should we name our class?

Well, object oriented programming tells us to 'hunt down the nouns', i.e.
find the most appropriate noun to name your class.

The noun here is 'Task', which is why we named the class 'Task'.

A class is a blueprint of what a 'Task' might look like.

e.g. a 'Task' probably has a description.

Rest of what you need to know is in Task.php in this folder.
