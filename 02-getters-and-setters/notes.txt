We can create classes now, great!

But what happens when we want to update some of the properties of a class?

By using getters and setters!

Let's say we have a Person class.

This 'Person' has a name and and age.

What happens when we want to 'get' our persons age?

What happens if that person can only be over 18?

Getters and setters provide us that extra protection.

In our 'setter' method we could write an if statement that won't allow under 18s.

Getters and setters are a security measure or a hook to do stuff when we want to update properties of a class object.
